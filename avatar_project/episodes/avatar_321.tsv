Ozai	  Come on out  Avatar, you can't  hide in there forever!
Sokka	 Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in the turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others.
Toph	 Got it. 
Sokka	  Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?
Toph	 You could stand to mention it more.
Sokka	  My leg!  Hang on Toph!
Toph	 Aye aye, Captain.
Sokka	 Bye Space Sword.
Sokka	I don't think Boomerang is coming back, Toph.  It looks like this is the end.
Toph	 How did that happen? Did Boomerang come back? 
Sokka	  No,  Suki did.
Ozai	 Come on out little boy,  you're about to be...
Azula	 I'd really rather our family physician look after  little Zuzu if you don't  mind!
Azula	  Zuzu,  you don't look so good! 
Azula	 There you  are, filthy peasant!
Zuko	 Thank you, Katara.
Katara	  I think I'm the one who should be thanking you.
Aang	  Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now  you shall pay the ultimate price. 
Aang	  No... I'm not going to end it like this.
Ozai	 Even with all the power in the World,  you are still weak.
Lion Turtle	In the era before the Avatar, we bend not the elements,  but the energy within  ourselves. 
Lion Turtle	  To bend another's energy, your own spirit  must be unbendable, or you will be corrupted  and destroyed.
Ozai	  What...what did you do to me? 
Aang	 I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again.
Sokka	" You did it! You should have seen yourself, it was amazing!  You were all like,  ""pshoom, pfoom, pfoom, phish, whoom"", and then the Fire Lord was all like,  ""eugh, eh, eh, eh, eugh, aye""."
Suki	 So, did you...  you know...finish the job?
Ozai	  I'm still alive.
Aang	 I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away.
Toph	  Wow, who taught you that? 
Aang	  A giant Lion Turtle.
Toph	 You have the craziest adventures when you disappear.
Sokka	"  Well, look at you buster. Now that your firebending is gone, I guess we should call you the ""Loser Lord"". "
Ozai	  I am the Phoenix King!
Toph	" Oh sorry, didn't mean to offend you ""Phoenix King of  Getting His Butt Whupped."""
Suki	"  Yeah, or how about ""King of the Guys Who... Don't Win"" "
Toph	  Leave the nicknames to us  honey.
Mai	 You need some help with that? 
Zuko	  Mai!  You're ok.  They let you out of prison? 
Mai	 My uncle  pulled some strings,  and it doesn't hurt when the new Fire Lord is your boyfriend. 
Zuko	 So does this mean you don't hate me anymore? 
Mai	  I think it means...  I actually  kind of like you.  But don't ever  break up  with me again. 
Sokka	Dad!
Katara	 Dad! 
Hakoda	 I heard what you two did.  I am the proudest father in the world.  And your mother  would be proud too. 
Sokka	  There's my favorite warriors. I have to admit,  I kind of missed the face paint. How does it feel to be back in uniform again  
Ty Lee	 It feels great! 
Sokka	  Careful Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again.
Suki	 It's ok.  She's one of us now. 
Ty Lee	 Yeah, the girls and I  really bonded in prison.  And after a few Chi blocking lessons, they said I could join their group.  We're going to be  best friends forever.
Zuko	 I can't believe a year ago my purpose in life was hunting you down, and now...
Aang	  And now we're friends.
Zuko	 Yeah...we are friends. 
Aang	 I can't believe a year ago  I was still frozen in a block of ice. The World's so different now.
Zuko	  And it's gonna be even more different, when we build it together.
Zuko	 Please, the real hero  is the Avatar. 
Zuko	 Today, this war is finally over. (Cut to Haru, Tyro,
Fire Sage	 All hail  Fire Lord Zuko!
Ozai	 I should count myself lucky.  The new Fire Lord has graced me with his presence in my lonely prison cell.
Zuko	You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life.  Banishing me was the best thing you could have done for my life.  It put me on the right path; perhaps your time in here can do the same for you.
Ozai	  Why are you really here?
Zuko	  Because you are gong to tell me something.  Where is my mother?
Sokka	 Zuko, stop moving!  I'm trying to capture the moment.  I wanted  to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. 
Katara	 That's very thoughtful of you Sokka.  Wait!  Why did you give me Momo's ears?
Sokka	  Those are your hair loopies. 
Zuko	 At least you don't look like a boarcupine.  My hair's not that spiky!
Mai	  I look like a man. 
Suki	 And why did you paint me firebending? 
Sokka	  I thought it looked more exciting that way. 
Sokka	 Oh, you  think you can do a better job, Momo?
Iroh	 Hey,  my belly's not that big anymore,  I've really trimmed down.
Toph	 Well, I think  you all look perfect!
