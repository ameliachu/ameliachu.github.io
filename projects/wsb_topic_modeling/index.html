    <h3>Topic Modelling with GME Megathreads on r/WallStreetBets</h3>
    <h5>Introduction </h5>

    <p>Over the course of three days, GameStop Stock (NYSE: GME) rose from less than $50 to a peak of more than $350 on
      January 27th, 2021. This change was largely attributed to a Reddit community called r/WallStreetBets (WSB). Some
      WSB users noticed that many hedge funds had taken a short position on GameStop and were convinced that the stock
      price was undervalued ("The frenzied rise", 2021). As more WSB users purchased GME stock, hedge funds and other
      professional investors, who had previously taken up a short position, were forced to buy GME shares to offset
      their losses, driving the stock price up further. General panic ensued on Wall Street, and spurred widespread,
      in-depth mainstream media coverage as the general public started to take notice (Reader’s guide, 2021; McCabe,
      2021). Some worried the trend set off by r/WallStreetBets could lead to more long lasting issues in the economy as
      WSB users had started looking at other stocks such as AMC (El-Erian, 2021).</p>
    <p>However, not everyone was pessimistic about this new influx of retail investors. When venture capitalist Chamath
      Palihapitiya spoke positively on the matter with CNBC, he outlined three types of users who actively participated
      in the WallStreetBets GME movement: (1) people who are investment or finance aficionados who were just as good or
      better than professional hedge fund analysts, (2) people who recall the 2008 financial crisis and had continuously
      felt abandoned by the establishment, (3) people who are seeking more transparency in conversations around
      investments and Wall Street in general (CNBC Television, 2021). This project will attempt to identify these user
      groups (or any other groups) in the WSB community using text data.</p>

    <h6>Hypotheses</h6>

    <p>There are a few places online where the WallStreetBets community is active and text data can be collected, such
      as Discord, Twitter, and Reddit. As the majority of online activity takes place on the subreddit and, as it is
      most straightforward to collect text data from there, we use comments from the subreddit r/WallStreetBets for
      analyses. We would want to identify the three groups mentioned in the CNBC interview in WSB, by examining
      comments, potential topic groups for those comments, and how authors different by topics of their comments.</p>
    <p>At
      first glance, comments and posts that fall under the three categories exist. Reflecting the first category of
      investment or finance aficionados, there are authors in the subreddit posting thoughtfully on their positions
      (e.g.
      Jeffamazon, 2020). Demonstrating the second category, there is this comment from a small business owner: "Small
      business owner who bought some shares of GME in the $98 dip. Will hold no matter what because I remember occupy
      and
      not seeing anyone responsible in a bright orange jump suit... fuck ‘em. Buy and hold." Finally, a comment that
      demonstrates the third category is: "This isn't a conspiracy thread, it is the antidote to conspiracy. I'm calling
      for an opportunity for transparency to be established. That is the best antidote to delusion." Although there are
      individual comments and submissions that reflect the categories, we will have to investigate further to determine
      if
      there are discernible patterns that could define these groups.</p>
    <p>would also probably not expect authors to only post comments that fall neatly into a single topic. However, we
      may find that authors largely post comments that fall into one topic, but also post comments that fall into
      another
      (e.g. an author that uses finance aficionados language, but also laments the 2008 financial crisis).</p>

    <h5>Data and Methods</h5>

    <h6>Data Retrieval and Preprocessing</h6>
    <p>To obtain text data for analyses, comments were harvested from the subreddit Wall Street Bets (r/wallstreetbets)
      with a Reddit API wrapper named PRAW. Submissions (Reddit's name for a post or discussion thread) that contained
      the word "GME" and "Megathread" were queried to identify comments and conversations most related to the GameStop
      stock. This resulted in 44 submissions with comments ranging from Jan 21, 2021 Apr 17, 2021 for a total of 349,024
      comments. Due to API constraints, there were three submissions where there were difficulties retrieving comments
      (submission ids: l4syrd, lm7n51, m16emz). Submission m16emz became retrievable when limited to the top 60,000
      comments, but not for l4syrd and lm7n51. It is unclear why the API limit occurred as there were submissions
      harvested (e.g. m0fpgd) with more than 60,000 comments without issue.</p>
    <p>Each comment was collected with information on its associated submission id, creation time (in UTC), author, and
      a score (in Reddit any comment can be upvoted or downvoted, and the net value is the "score"). Any comment that
      was deleted (i.e. appeared as "[deleted]") was removed from analysis. Finally, all comments from the 42
      retrievable submissions were combined into a single csv file and read into R.
    </p>
    <p> From there, the text column was converted into a document frequency matrix (DFM) with all tokens lowercase,
      punctuation removed, numbers removed and stop words as well as link prefixes (i.e.. "http","https") removed.
      Tokens were lowercased and punctuation was removed as the quantity of punctuation (e.g. "BUY THE DIP AND HOLD
      GME!!!!!") and case toggling (e.g. "Finally able to afford GME. Let’s GOOoOo") can often be arbitrary in this
      corpus. Numbers were also removed as there are many references to the current price of stocks (e.g. "Did gme just
      freeze at 119.51 for anyone else?", "Purchased another share @114."). Finally, stop words and link prefixes were
      removed so that words that differentiate the comments can be given more focus.</p>
    <h6>Defining Topics from LDA Model (k = 6)</h6>
    <p>To obtain the topics of comments, an LDA model was used. To determine the k value for the model, the LDA Tuning
      metrics Griffiths2004", "CaoJuan2009", "Arun2010", and "Deveaud2014" were used with k candidates between range 2
      to 10 evaluated (Figure 1).

      </script>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">k = 6 was identified as the best option that maximized Deveaud2014 and
        Griffiths2004 while minimizing Arun2010 and CaoJuan2009. Therefore, an LDA model with Gibbs sampling set at k=6
        was used to determine topics. This yielded topics with the top terms in Figure 2.

              With the exception of "us" in the top terms, it's not readily apparent what distinguishes this particular
              topic. However, when examining the comments, it appears that a lot of the community-oriented comments have
              fallen into this topic, as illustrated in the examples below:

    <h6>K-Means Clustering to Determine Author Groups</h6>
    <p>After determining the topics, the data was prepared for k-means clustering to determine author groups. Each
      comment
      was assigned a single topic from the LDA model (retrieving the top 1-3 associated topics was also attempted,
      however
      the likelihoods became extremely low). The data was aggregated by author to obtain the number of comments the
      author
      had posted in each topic. The number of comments were then logged to reduce the influence of outliers.</p>

    <p> When clustering for authors, k was set at 3, 6, 8, and 10. When k = 3, it seemed like there were far too few
      clusters. With the exception of cluster 2, the distribution of comments by topics appeared to be more or less
      even,
      and it seems like the key differentiator between clusters was the average number of total comments (Table 1.a). k
      =
      8 clusters seems like the lowest number where there are clear groups of authors (Table 1.c). As expected, the
      author
      clusters are a mix of topics. Some clusters are less clear why it is helpful to distinguish, but here's how they
      differentiate.</p>

    <h5>Discussion</h5>
    <p>The subreddit r/WallStreetBets has brought traditionally closed-door discussions to an open forum. This could be
      a powerful tool in disseminating and demystifying wealth building knowledge to the general public. And, because
      this is wealth-building knowledge, this can also attract a toxic crowd (e.g. of the Cluster 6 variety). Because
      this forum can serve as a powerful force of positive change, it's important to be able to identify who or which
      authors to follow (e.g. of the Cluster 2 variety) and who are the positive community builders (e.g. Cluster 8).
      Being able to distinguish the aficionados and community builders could not only lend credibility to
      r/WallStreetBets but also could help track the sustainability of the community. </p>
    <p>There are quite a few improvements and further work that could be done to better this analysis. This roughly
      falls into two categories: (1) Improvements to current data and modelling pipeline and (2) incorporating evolution
      or time considerations into the model.</p>

    <h6>Potential Improvements to the Current Pipeline</h6>

    <p>There were a few submissions that were unable to be included into this analysis due to the constraint of the PRAW
      API. The big-data storage platform, pushshift, has copies of all reddit comments and an accessible API which could
      be used to fill in any gaps in comment collection. We should probably also remove bot comments (e.g. from
      AutoModerator) and check to see if there are other tokens that should be removed (e.g. "[removed]"). The
      "[removed]" token may have some utility when aggregated as a count for each author (i.e. to determine how often
      the author retracts their comment or is penalized by their community).</p>
    <p> Out of the three initial types of users discussed, we were only able to find the aficionados. Only a handful of
      k's
      were evaluated as potential values for the LDA model, thus one improvement could be to evaluate more k's for
      topics,
      to determine if there was a better value. There were some comments that were assigned a certain topic, but were
      assigned another. For example, "IT SMELLS LIKE A BITCH IN HERE. Hold retards" seems like it should belong in topic
      5
      but was assigned topic 2. Quite a few of the top terms appear to be potential collocations (e.g. "short" &
      "squeeze", "share" & "price"). We could also potentially look at collocations and see how topics change when they
      are accounted for.</p>
    <h6>Evolution Considerations and Changes Over Time</h6>

    <p> To examine changes (or consistency) to the community over time, we could try an STM model. We could also
      visualize
      topic usage over time and superimpose stock price data and key events (e.g. GameStop CEO stepping down, quarterly
      earning calls) to examine changes. We can also perform comparisons between the GME Megathread submissions and the
      Daily Discussion Thread, to see if topic prevalence changes between submission types. Finally, we may want to
      examine if users differ in language convention depending on when they started commenting on WSB like in
      Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, West, Jurafsky, Leskovec, & Potts (2013). Or if users influence each other's language?
      That
      is, could new authors that start off with Topic 1 comments slowly start posting more Topic 3 comments after more
      time on the subreddit? Or could authors that comment mainly in Topic 3, drift toward Topic 5, due to the influx of
      Topic 5 comments / Cluster 6 authors? </p>
